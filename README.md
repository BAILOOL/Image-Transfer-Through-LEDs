# Image-Transfer-Through-LEDs
In this Project we took the opportunity to develop a reliable method for navigation inside buildings (usually big sanctuaries like libraries) where itâ€™s often hard to reference oneself inside the building and where technologies like GPS fails to do so as well. As a medium, we use LEDs to send data, while on the other side, a camera will record the sent data in real time and reproduce the original data at the receiver side.
